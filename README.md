# The Impact of Red Cards on Match Outcomes: An Analysis of Win Probabilities

## Description:
In this analysis, I delve into the intricate world of football to determine how receiving red cards influences a team's chance of winning. Utilizing comprehensive match data, the project investigates the relationship between red cards received by teams and their match outcomes. The insights are presented through various visualizations, revealing pivotal trends and patterns in the data.

## Key Findings:
Red cards held little influence on the chance of a team winning.

## Tools & Technologies:
Python
Pandas
Matplotlib
Seaborn

## How to Use:
Clone the repository.
Install the required packages using pip install -r requirements.txt.
Run the Jupyter Notebook.

## Data Source:
The dataset comprises match statistics like shots, fouls, goals, and, most importantly, red cards, spanning a specific time period of one year (2018 through 2019).

## Future Work:
I'd like to see if there are any other variables that would have more of an influence on the chances of a team winning. I also plan to update the visualizations by adding either a box plot or a scatter plot.
